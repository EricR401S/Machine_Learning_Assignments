# Machine_Learning_Assignments


Hello, this is a repository holding my machine learning class's projects. I will provide a short description of what I did for all of them from the second assignment onwards, as the first was just a refresher on Math fundamentals.


## Assignment 2 : Building a KNN from Scratch
---

As the title implies, the goal was to build a KNN from scratch and experiment with tuning the K hyperparameter to evaluate overfitting and underfitting. This model was also compared to a more biased linear model, and it was also compared to the scikit-learn's implementation of the KNN. 


## Assignment 3 : Building a Logistic Model from Scratch
---

The goal of the project was to experiment with learning rates and how it affects the gradient descent's updating of the weights as well as the validation and training costs, especially when building a logistic regression model from scratch. The handmade model was compared to the sklearn implementation via the use of decision boundaries, ROC curves and PR curves.

## Assignment 4 : Building a Neural Network from Scratch
---

For this project, the main purpose was to learn how to tune the hyperparameters of a Neural Network via Random Search to find the best performing model. In addition, another component of the problem was coding a neural network implementation from scratch to compare it to a scikit-learn MLP classifier. 

## Assignment 5 : Conducting Unsupervised Learning Experiments and Competing in a Class Kaggle Competition
---

The goal of this assignment was to, firstly, chain and test models to achieve the best predictive power on the problem of predicting hotel bookings, a binary outcome. The data was to be preprocessed and cleaned, and then it was fed into model pipelines, which were hyperparameter tuned. I actually won this year's competition. As for the second half, I test K-Means clustering, T-SNE, and DBSCAN to find the best ways to cluster data.

## Assignment 6 : Monte Carlo for finding the Value and Action-Value Functions
---

The fun in this assignment was implementing a way to define the optimal policy for the value and action-value functions for a simplified blackjack game. It took a few million episodes to reach the best policy.
