# Machine_Learning_Assignments


Hello, this is a repository holding my machine learning class's projects. I will provide a short description of what I did for all of them from the second assignment onwards, as the first was just a refresher on Math fundamentals.


## Assignment 2 : Building a KNN from Scratch
---

As the title implies, the goal was to build a KNN from scratch and experiment with tuning the K hyperparameter to evaluate overfitting and underfitting. This model was also compared to a more biased linear model, and it was also compared to the scikit-learn's implementation of the KNN. 


## Assignment 3 : Building a Logistic Model from Scratch
---

The goal of the project was to experiment with learning rates and how it affects the gradient descent's updating of the weights as well as the validation and training costs, especially when building a logistic regression model from scratch. The handmade model was compared to the sklearn implementation via the use of decision boundaries, ROC curves and PR curves.

## Assignment 4 : Building a Neural Network from Scratch

For this project, the main purpose was to learn how to tune the hyperparameters of a Neural Network via Random Search to find the best performing model. In addition, another component of the problem was coding a neural network implementation from scratch to compare it to a scikit-learn MLP classifier.
