# Machine_Learning_Assignments


Hello, this is a repository holding my machine learning class's projects. I will provide a short description of what I did for all of them from the second assignment onwards, as the first was just a refresher on Math fundamentals.


Assignment 2 : Building a KNN from Scratch

As the title implies, the goal was to build a KNN from scratch and experiment with tuning the K hyperparameter to evaluate overfitting and underfitting. This model was also compared to a more biased linear model, and it was also compared to the scikit-learn's implementation of the KNN.
