    "With the passage of time, it is evident that less men are pursuing bachelor's degrees and graduate degrees. For the group that is 40 and older (those born on 1976 and earlier), the men had a slightly higher share of college attainment rate than women. For those 40 and below, the gap grows to from hardly a percentage point to approximately 8 percentage points, where men are earning less college degrees. In addition, due to having prior knowledge of this declining trend, I decided to filter and crosstab for the group between 40 and 22. My reasoning is due to skewing by young undergraduate students who are yet to graduate. Predictably, 31% of men in this range were earning degrees versus the 41% of women. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recent trends have been very telling of this phenomenon. Most deserters in high school are men, for example. Therefore, there is an underlying root issue that is causing young men to value education less. In addition, there are industries that do not require men to attain degrees in order to work, such as construction, as well as specialized, short-term projects for certain jobs (i.e. electricians and car repairs). In contrast, focus on female education has incremented due to a cultural shift for wanting more female, college-educated professionals. However, interestingly enough, many of these \"strength\" or hard labor industries are still highly populated by men, and recent studies have shown that females tend to follow the college route and avoid these types of hard labor industries altogether. To conclude, these are some factors influencing the current trends, but there are many more due to the multiple influences affecting them.  "
